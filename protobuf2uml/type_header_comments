ExpressionUnits	e.g. FPKM or TPM
RnaQuantification	an analysis of reads, the result of running the described programs on the specified reads and assignment to the listed annotation
Characterization	Mostly mapping/alignment data, along with reference to an analysis
FeatureGroup	Used to identify a group of features(?) for use by ExpressionLevel
ExpressionLevel	Actual numerical quantification for each feature??
Program	Tracks how read data was generated
ReadStats	Summary statistics of read data
ReadGroup	Set of reads derived from one physical sequencing process
ReadGroupSet	logical collection of ReadGroups: e.g. all reads from one experimental sample
LinearAlignment	alignment of a read to a Reference, using a position and CIGAR array.
ReadAlignment	alignment with additional information about the fragment and the read, equivalent to line in SAM file
ReferenceSet	a reference assembly, e.g. GRCh38
Reference	an immutable contig
Variant	change in DNA sequence relative to some reference, e.g. SNP or insertion.
Call	determination (i.e. a probability) of genotype with respect to a particular variant
VariantSet	collection of variants and variant calls intended to be analyzed together
CallSet	collection of calls generated by analysis of same sample
VariantSetMetaData	Optional metadata associated with a variant set
VariantAnnotation	Result of comparing variant to a set of reference data
TranscriptEffect	Describes effect of allele on transcript. One record for each alternate allele.
AnalysisResult	Output of prediction package, e.g. SIFT
AlleleLocation	Location of allele relative to non-genomic coordinate system, e.g. CDS
Impact	Effect of allele on protein function, e.g. HIGH or MODERATE
VariantAnnotationSet	derived from VariantSet, contains VariantAnnotation records, describes software and reference data used in annotation
HGVSAnnotation	Human Genome Variation Society descriptions of the sequence change with respect to genomic, transcript and protein sequences. http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/recs.html
Attributes	Attributes/values associated with various protocol records
Feature	Node in annotation graph that annotates a contiguous region of a sequence
